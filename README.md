# Sparse Matrix

This project implements basic implementations on a matrix: addition, subtraction
and multiplication.

The matrices are stored as a sparse matrix and the user runs the program, giving
it 2 matrices as input and choosing the desired operation.

After the operation, the result will be stored in `result.txt`
